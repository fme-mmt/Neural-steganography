We were trying to run the GPT2 in Google Colab using special tutioral.
Changing options with additng special fragments of code.
We opened with this program the text editor but it was an error, even a few (we think conncted with the security of computer) so i twas impossible to add a message.
We agreed that we have to try on our own computers for he next week.
