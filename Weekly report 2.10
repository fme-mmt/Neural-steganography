We were trying to run the GPT2 in Google Colab using special tutioral.
Changing options with additng special fragments of code.
We opened with this program the text editor but it was an error, even a few (we think conncted with the security of computer) so i twas impossible to add a message.
We agreed that we have to try on our own computers for he next week.

We have been learning a little bit more about Python using CodeAcademy and SoloLearn which are two good websites to improve programming skills.
After that we have been searching information about PyTorch and how to use it.

I have been learning about arithmetic coding and how it works. Next day I'll do a presantation to my teammates about what I learnt.
