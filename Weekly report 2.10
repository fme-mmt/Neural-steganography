We were trying to run the GPT2 in Google Colab using special tutioral.
Changing options with additng special fragments of code.
We opened with this program the text editor but it was an error, even a few (we think conncted with the security of computer) so i twas impossible to add a message.
We agreed that we have to try on our own computers for he next week.

We have been learning a little bit more about Python using CodeAcademy and SoloLearn which are two good websites to improve programming skills.
After that we have been searching information about PyTorch and how to use it.

I have been learning about arithmetic coding and how it works. Next day I'll do a presantation to my teammates about what I learnt.

We made the gpt-2 model work and tried some samples-
We installed markovify packages and we made it work correctly. 
We tried some samples to see with what kind of samples it works better 
Given a long enough samples (article, songs etc.) to finally make the program work corectly with no errors, no repeats etc.

We have downloaded Markovify too. 
We have started reading only one simple text using the command state_size=2, what means that we only look at the last word to write the next one.
That have given us mostly non correct sentences. 
After that, we have been trying to use state_size=3, what means that we look at the last two words.
That would have to give us more correct sentences, but the problem we have had here is that our text was so simple to make any new sentence. 
Finally, we are trying to download some corpus, principally the wikipedia one from Textacy but some errors have appeared to us.
So now we are trying to solve that errors to run the code and see what happens to the sentences we are creating.

Everybody
Create a large corpus.

RogerS & Gerard:
We've been looking at the Markovify implementation and how it generates and choose the next possible words. 
We have been wondering about how to implement arithmetic coding in Markovify and how the program will encrypt and decrypt the text we want.
